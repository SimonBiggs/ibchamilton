## Biblical Authority

The Bible is the final authority in all matters of belief and practice because the Bible is inspired by God Himself. The Bible is comprised of the Old and New Testaments and is infallible and inerrant. The Bible is the Word of God!
 
## Autonomy of the Local Church

The local church is an independent body accountable to the Lord Jesus Christ. No religious 
hierarchy may dictate its beliefs or practices. The church is self-governing.
 
## God

There is only one living and true God, Creator and absolute Ruler. In the unity of the 
Godhead there are three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit; equal and of 
one nature and substance in every divine perfection.
 
## Jesus Christ

Jesus is the Christ, the only begotten Son of God and God the Son. He was born of a virgin by the power of the Holy Spirit. He lived a perfect life, died on the cross to pay the penalty for sin, rose bodily from the dead and ascended alive into heaven. Jesus is fully God and fully Man in one person.
 
## Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit is a divine person. He is one with God the Father and God the Son (Jesus Christ). He 
is the Agent of the new birth at salvation. He baptizes, indwells, seals, fills, enlightens, guides, teaches, witnesses, sanctifies and helps the believer. The Spirit distributes gifts to believers, as He determines, for 
the building up of the church.

## Salvation

Everyone has sinned (broken God’s Law) and is separated from God. The penalty for sin is death and eternal separation from God. Jesus Christ satisfied the just demands of a holy and righteous God by dying on the cross for our sins. He rose from the dead to defeat sin and death and prove that He is truly the Son of God. Forgiveness of sin and complete reconciliation with God is possible by turning away from sin (repentance) and receiving Jesus Christ as Savior. Salvation is by God’s Grace through Faith and does not involve any good works that we do. One who is truly saved is kept secure by God forever.
 
## Individual Soul Liberty

Every individual has the liberty to choose what he or she believes. No one should be forced to believe against his will; however, this does not exempt one from accountability to God.
