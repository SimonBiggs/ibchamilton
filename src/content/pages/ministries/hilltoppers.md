## What is a Hilltopper?

An Immanuel Baptist Church Hilltopper is anyone that is young-at-heart, likes to have a good time fellowshipping with believers and doing the work of the Lord.

There are no dues to pay and no registration forms to fill out. We encourage everyone to come and join the Hilltoppers on our day and overnight trips and as we minister to the community in our volunteer work.
