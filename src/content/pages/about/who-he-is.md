Jesus is the One we worship! He is the reason that Immanuel Baptist Church exists. We gather to worship and praise Him and to learn more about Him from God’s Word, the Bible. We have a very good reason for doing this:

Jesus wasn’t just an ordinary man. The Bible tells us that Jesus was born of a virgin by the power of the Holy Spirit without a human father. This miracle happened so that He could be born without sin.

Jesus is human but He is also God. The Bible tells us that “in Him [Jesus] dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily” Colossians 2:9.

This is very important to understand because sin has separated us from God. Sin is anything we do that disobeys God’s Law. The Bible says that “all have sinned and come short of the glory of God” Romans 3:23. It also says that “the wages [penalty] of sin is death” Romans 6:23. That means more than just physical death…that means eternal spiritual separation from God. There is nothing we can do on our own to earn forgiveness of our sins. We are powerless to repair the damage that sin has caused.

But God Loved us so much that He wanted to fix things Himself…to give us a way to come back to Him and have a relationship with Him. He did this by sending His only Son, Jesus Christ, into the world to live a perfect life, to die on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins (remember Romans 6:23?) and rise again from the dead to prove that He had once and for all defeated sin and death!

You can have your sins forgiven and have your relationship with God completely fixed by admitting that you are a sinner and putting your complete Trust in Jesus as the only One who can forgive you and make you a new person. Jesus said, “I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, no one comes to the Father except through me” John 14:6.
God Loves you! He wants to forgive you and have a relationship with you and give you an eternal home in heaven with Him.

Give your life to Jesus today. Then contact us to let us know of your decision. We want to pray for you and help you grow in your new life in Jesus Christ.
